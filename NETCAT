Netcat (ncat, nc):
- Utilize to interact with TCP/UDP ports
- Connect to shells with it
- Example syntax:
  netcat 10.10.10.10 22
    - IP and port
- This is called banner grabbing which helps ID what service is running on a particular port
- Windows alternative is called PowerCat https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat
- socat (https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat) is also used when needing to upgrade a shell to full interactive or when needing to forward ports and connect 
to serial devices

- Banner Grabbing: nc -nv <ip address> <port>
  - -n: Do not do any DNS or service lookups on any specified addresses, hostnames or ports.
  - -v: more verbose output


- Setting up netcat listener for reverse shell:

  - nc -lvnp 1234
    - -l: Listen mode, to wait for connection
    - -v: Verbose mode, so we know when we receive a connection
    - -n: Disable DNS resolution and only connect from/to IPs, to speed up connection
    - -p: Port number netcat is listening on
