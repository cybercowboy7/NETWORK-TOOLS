- MAC/Linux == 68


HOST AND PORT SCANNING:

- Different Port states:
open	                  This indicates that the connection to the scanned port has been established. These connections can be TCP connections, UDP datagrams as well as SCTP associations.
closed	                When the port is shown as closed, the TCP protocol indicates that the packet we received back contains an RST flag. This scanning method can also be used to determine if our target is alive or not.
filtered	              Nmap cannot correctly identify whether the scanned port is open or closed because either no response is returned from the target for the port or we get an error code from the target.
unfiltered	            This state of a port only occurs during the TCP-ACK scan and means that the port is accessible, but it cannot be determined whether it is open or closed.
open|filtered	          If we do not get a response for a specific port, Nmap will set it to that state. This indicates that a firewall or packet filter may protect the port.
closed|filtered	        This state only occurs in the IP ID idle scans and indicates that it was impossible to determine if the scanned port is closed or filtered by a firewall.

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10
- Scans top ten ports

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 --top-ports=10 
-Pn: Disable the ICMP echo requests
-n: DNS resolution
--disable-arp-ping: disables arp ping

- Connect Scan
  -sT: utilizes 3-way handshake and is most accurate way of determining state of port
    - Not stealthy
sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 443 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -Pn -n --reason -sT
-Pn: Disable the ICMP echo requests
-n: DNS resolution
-sT: TCP connect scan

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 139 --packet-trace -n --disable-arp-ping -Pn

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU
-F: Scans top 100 ports
-sU: Performs a UDP scan

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -sU -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 137 --reason 


sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -p 445 --reason  -sV



SAVING THE RESULTS:

Normal output       (-oN) with the .nmap file extension
Grepable output     (-oG) with the .gnmap file extension
XML output          (-oX) with the .xml file extension

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p- -oA target

To convert XML format to HTML you can utilize: xsltproc target.xml -o target.html



SERVICE ENUMERATION:

sudo nmap <ip address> -p- -sV --stats-every=5s

--stats-every=5s : Defines the periods of time the status should be shown

OR

-v / -vv : Increases the verbosity of the output



NMAP SCRIPTING ENGINE:

14 categories in which these scripts can be divided:

auth	                      Determination of authentication credentials.
broadcast	                  Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
brute	                      Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
default	                    Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
discovery	                  Evaluation of accessible services.
dos	                        These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
exploit	                    This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
external	                  Scripts that use external services for further processing.
fuzzer	                    This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
intrusive	                  Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
malware	                    Checks if some malware infects the target system.
safe	                      Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
version	                    Extension for service detection.
vuln	                      Identification of specific vulnerabilities.

Default Scripts: sudo nmap <target> -sC

Specific Scripts Category: sudo nmap <target> --script <category>

Defined Scripts: sudo nmap <target> --script <script-name>,<script-name>,...

Specifiying Scripts: sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 25 --script banner,smtp-commands

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -A
  -A: This scans the target with multiple options as service detection (-sV), OS detection (-O), traceroute (--traceroute) and with the default NSE scripts (-sC)

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:

sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sV --script vuln 



PERFORMANCE:

(Optimized)(RTT stands for Round-trip-time)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms --max-rtt-timeout 100ms
-F: Scans top 100 ports
--initial-rtt-timeout 50ms: Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout
--max-rtt-timeout 100ms: Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout


(Not Optimized)
sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F


MAX RETRIES:

To increase scan speed you can specify the rerty rate of sent packets (--max-retries). Default value 10, but we can reduce it to 0

Default Scan: sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

Reduced Retries: sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F --max-retries 0 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l



RATES:

Setting minimum rate (--min-rate <number>)

Default Scan: sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.default
  -oN: Saves the results in normal formats, starting the specified file name
  --min-rate 300: Sets the minimum number of packets to be sent per second

Default Scan Found Open Ports: cat tnet.default | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

Optimized Scan Found Open Ports:  cat tnet.minrate300 | grep "/tcp" | wc -l

Insane Scan: sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -F -oN tnet.T5 -T 5
  -T 5: Specifies the insnae timing template



FIREWALL AND IDS/IPS EVASION:

- Determine FIrewalls and their rules:
Firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections:
  - Dropped: Ignored and no response from the host
  - Rejected: Packets are returned with an RST flag
    - These packets contain different types of ICMP error codes or contain nothing at all:
      - Net Unreachable
      - Net Prohibited
      - Host Unreachable
      - Host Prohibited
      - Port Unreachable
      - Proto Unreachable

-sA: Much harder to filter for firewalls and IDS/IPS systems than regular SYN (-sS) or Connect Scans (-sT) because they only send a TCP packet with only the ACK flag.

- When a port is closed or open, the host must respond with an RST flag.

- All connection attempts with the SYN flag from external networks are usually blocked by firewalls

- Packets with the ACK flag are often passed by the firewall because the firewall cannot determine whether the connection was first established from the external network or the internal network

SYN-Scan: sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

ACK-Scan: sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 21,22,25 -sA -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace


DETECT IDS/IPS:

- One method to determine whether such IPS system is present in the target network is to scan from a single host (VPS). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, 
we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another VPS.

- Decoy scans: 
  -D: Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent
    - Can generate random (RND) a specific number (for example: 5) of IP addresses separated by a colon (:).

SCAN by using DECOYS: sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p 80 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace -D RND:5

- Spoofed packets are often filtered out by ISPs and routers, even though they come from the same network range

- Can specify VPS servers' IP addresses and use them in combination with "IP ID" manipulation in the IP headers to scan the target

-S: Manually specify the source IP address to test if we get better results

Testing firewall rule: sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p445 -O

Scan by Using Different Source IP: sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p 445 -O -S 10.129.2.200 -e tun0

- By default, Nmap performs a reverse DNS resolution unless otherwise specified to find more important information about our target.

- DNS queries are made over UDP 53

- Can specify DNS servers ourselves (--dns-server <ns>, <ns>)
  - Can be fundamental if we are in a DMZ
  - Can use TCP port 53 as source port (--source-port) for our scans

SYN-Scan of a Filtered Port:  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace

SYN-Scan From DNS Port:  sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -p50000 -sS -Pn -n --disable-arp-ping --packet-trace --source-port 53

Connect to filtered port using Netcat: ncat -nv --source-port 53 10.129.2.28 50000
